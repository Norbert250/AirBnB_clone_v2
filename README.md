# AirBnB_clone_v2
Creating an Airbnb clone using MySQL involves designing a database schema that captures the essential entities and relationships of the Airbnb platform. Here's a high-level overview of how you might structure such a MySQL database:

1. **Users**: 
   - This table stores information about users who interact with the platform. Fields might include user ID, username, email, password (hashed for security), profile information, etc.

2. **Listings**: 
   - This table represents properties listed on the platform. Each row corresponds to a single property. Fields might include listing ID, title, description, address, price per night, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, maximum occupancy, amenities, etc.

3. **Bookings**: 
   - This table tracks bookings made by users. Each row represents a booking. Fields might include booking ID, user ID (who made the booking), listing ID (which property is booked), check-in date, check-out date, total price, status (confirmed, pending, cancelled), etc.

4. **Reviews**: 
   - This table stores reviews that users leave for listings. Fields might include review ID, user ID (who left the review), listing ID (which listing the review is for), rating, review text, timestamp, etc.

5. **Images**: 
   - This table stores images associated with listings. Each row represents an image. Fields might include image ID, listing ID (which listing the image belongs to), image URL, caption, etc.

6. **Wishlists**:
   - This table allows users to save listings to their wishlists. Fields might include wishlist ID, user ID (who owns the wishlist), listing ID (which listing is in the wishlist), timestamp, etc.

7. **Locations**:
   - This table contains geographic information about locations. Fields might include location ID, city, state, country, latitude, longitude, etc. This table can be linked to the Listings table to associate each listing with its location.

When designing the schema, you need to consider relationships between these entities. For example:

- One-to-Many relationship between Users and Listings (one user can have multiple listings).
- One-to-Many relationship between Users and Bookings (one user can make multiple bookings).
- One-to-Many relationship between Listings and Bookings (one listing can have multiple bookings).
- One-to-Many relationship between Listings and Reviews (one listing can have multiple reviews).
- One-to-Many relationship between Listings and Images (one listing can have multiple images).
- Many-to-Many relationship between Users and Listings for wishlists (one user can have multiple listings in their wishlist, and one listing can be in multiple users' wishlists).

After designing the schema, you'll need to implement it in MySQL by creating tables, defining relationships, and writing queries to interact with the data. Additionally, you may consider adding indexes for faster data retrieval and enforcing constraints to maintain data integrity.
